# Shell SCripting

## This project is aimed at onboarding 20 new users on a server.

I created a directory named **Shell**

Then, a file **names.csv** with the names of the 20 new users

Here is my **Shell Script**

I created a file for the public key
 ![PublicKey](./ImagesAuxProject/PublicKey.PNG)

Then a file for the private key
 ![PrivateKey](./ImagesAuxProject/PrivateKey.PNG)

I ran my script to read the names.csv file

To test a few users, I did the following;
- For the first user, *Flora* I copied the authorization key to the user folder and changed ownership
 ![cp/chown_auth_key](./ImagesAuxProject/cp_authrizationK_Flora.PNG) 

 - Changed access permission and connected to the server as *Flora*
 ![Connect_as_Flora](./ImagesAuxProject/Connect_to_Server_as_Flora.PNG)

- I also tried to connect to the server as *Leah*
